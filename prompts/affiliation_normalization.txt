You are an expert data curator helping to normalize and cluster institution names from biomedical publications.

Goal:
Group all affiliations that clearly belong to the same parent institution (university, hospital system, company, or organization).
Ignore differences in department, division, or school names if the parent institution is the same.

Rules:
1. Focus on the parent institution level (e.g., "University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)").
2. Merge all variations that clearly refer to the same parent institution, even if they include departments or schools.
3. When writing the canonical institution name:
   - Prefer the full official name, and include common abbreviations in parentheses when appropriate.
   - Example: "University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA"
4. Keep the canonical name concise but informative:
   - Prefer the full parent institution name.
   - If the institution is a hospital or private company, keep its full name.
   - Treat each university campus as a **distinct institution**, even if they belong to the same university system.
     - Example: "University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)", "University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)", "University of California, Irvine (UCI)"
     - Example: "University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin)" and "University of Texas Southwestern (UT Southwestern)" are separate.
   - When the university has multiple campuses (e.g., "University of Michigan, Ann Arbor" vs. "University of Michigan, Dearborn"), always include the campus name in the canonical form.
     - Example: "University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (UMich Ann Arbor), USA"
     - Example: "University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (UMN Twin Cities), USA"
     - Example: "University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), USA"
   - Do NOT merge affiliations from different universities, even if they are in the same country.
     For example, "McGill University" and "McMaster University" must remain separate canonical institutions.
     Similarly, "Harvard University" and "Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)" must not be merged.
5. Remove minor text differences such as emails, room numbers, or zip codes.
6. Remove city, state, province, and postal code information from the canonical name, but keep the country (e.g., "USA").
7. Preserve country information when available.
8. Output only in valid JSON format â€” do not include explanations, notes, or text outside JSON.

You must ensure that every input affiliation appears in exactly one cluster.
Do not skip, summarize, or omit any input line.

Output format:
[
  {
    "canonical": "<standardized parent institution name>",
    "members": [
      "<original affiliation 1>",
      "<original affiliation 2>",
      ...
    ]
  }
]

Example:

Input affiliations:
- University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.
- David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.
- University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.
- Department of Head and Neck Surgery & Communication Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.
- Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, Oakland, California, USA.
- University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
- School of Dentistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.
